            <p class="'intro">
                My name is Kenneth Smith, and I’m from Chicago, Illinois. I have a deep passion for learning, 
                and when something captures my interest, I dive in headfirst, always hungry for more knowledge. 
                often find myself on YouTube, soaking up new information. It’s an incredible resource, filled with 
                valuable knowledge just waiting to be discovered. <span class="sentence">Over the years, I’ve taught myself many practical 
                life skills through the internet.</span> 
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged. <span class="sentence">I love being outdoors, gaming, coding, and working 
                with cars.</span> There’s something special about nature—getting fresh air, soaking in the sunlight, and feeling
                the grass beneath your feet are simple pleasures that help me stay grounded and recharge. Being near water,
                especially the ocean, is my favorite; it’s incredibly rejuvenating. Gaming has always been a part of my life—growing
                up, my family and I would often play together to unwind after a long day. It’s a great way to escape reality for a while.
                Coding has become a new passion of mine in recent years. I’ve enjoyed learning new programming languages and applying them 
                to projects. As for cars, I’ve been a technician for 12 years, and building performance vehicles has naturally become 
                something I love. 
            </p>

            <p>
               <span class="sentence">"My childhood was incredible!</span> I’m fortunate to have grown up in a loving and caring environment, thanks to a wonderful family. 
               I have so many amazing memories from that time, it’s hard to know where to start. My parents instilled strong values in me, 
               pushing me to be tough when it was necessary. They also ingrained in me a powerful work ethic, and I truly believe they were 
               the foundation of this quality I possess today. Sometimes, I wish I could relive those years—it was such a special time in my life!
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m an easygoing person with a laid-back, chill personality. I’m easy to get along with and don’t need much to be content.
                I hold myself to high standards, always striving to become a better person each day. <span class ="sentence">I do my best to reach my goals, 
                no matter the challenges that come my way.</span> That’s a little about me. 
            </p>
